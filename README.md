# Features
## Feature 1
A calendar with daily and monthly accomplishments. Designed to incentivize habit-building behavior and establish trackable progress.
### Design
An web version of the APP, the calendar page has 60% filled with a monthly calendar at the top. And the other 40% below has a trophy (or some other meaningful icon) that has a gradient and can be filled, or that the line will increase as progress is made. This will be placed on the left side of the page, and right next to it there will be a main task title and a number underneath representing the actual score.
