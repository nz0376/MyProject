## Feature 1
A calendar with daily and monthly accomplishments. Designed to incentivize habit-building behavior and establish trackable progress.
### Design
An web version of the APP. We decide to make the calendar a smaller size on page to make room for other information and make sure that they can be accessed with ease. The new calendar should only have a long-strip, horizontally bar-shaped look and constitute the current date. If we click on it a pop-up will appear with a more complete calendar. We will also use a progress bar with a label of the percentage to mark instead of trophy as the latter will take up too much unncessary space. The gradient idea is kept and the marked line will increase as progress is made. Then, below the progress bar, we have a task list that constitute a variety of tasks we could input for guidance. The tasks will be prescribed because extensive literature review and research work will be poured into it to profile a list of activities that are suitable and appropriate for the physical strength level of the elder. It would thereby be safer and a better idea.
