# Features
## Feature 1 - Page 1
A calendar with daily and monthly accomplishments. Designed to incentivize habit-building behavior and establish trackable progress. I will be using react-datepicker for this feature.
### Design 1
An web version of the APP. We decide to make the calendar a smaller size on page to make room for other information and make sure that they can be accessed with ease. 
* The new calendar should only have a long-strip, horizontally bar-shaped look and constitute the current date. 
* If we click on it a pop-up will appear with a more complete calendar. 

### Design 2
We will also use a **progress bar** with a label of the percentage to mark instead of trophy as the latter will take up too much unncessary space. The gradient idea is kept and the marked line will increase as progress is made. 


### Design 3
Then, below the progress bar, we have a **task list** that constitute a variety of tasks we could input for guidance. The tasks will be prescribed because *extensive literature review and research work* will be poured into it to profile a list of activities that are suitable and appropriate for the physical strength level of the elder. It would thereby be safer and a better idea.

## Feature 2 - Page 2
We should also have a **main page**. The main page will be a summary of everything. To put it simply, it will be a summary page of everything at the user's control, such that the dates and the data picks of interest can be selected instead of given like the previous page does. If the first page is designed to incentivize, this page is designed to reflect back upon the path we've travelled. I will be using chart.js specifically for this feature.

### Design
The idea is to have a *pie chart/doughnut shaped look* to present and visualize the statistics we've gathered. We choose this specific shape because we believe the circular shape itself is reminiscent of something compelete, something wholesome, and unlike the bar chart or line charts that has a more implied or associated impression of progress and growth, our targeted group, the elders, would have a stronger inclination to fulfillment and harmony.
